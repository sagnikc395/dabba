## dabba

Dabba is a an implementation of a SQLite clone from scratch in Zig.

### Background:

I wanted to learn about database internals for a long time, and good resources exist to learn about [building a RDBMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otE2WvX3XdQ&list=PLSE8ODhjZXjYDBpQnSymaectKjxCy6BYq) from scratch - however, I was not interested about the network and the management layer, rather how the storage engines work under the hood. Also its a big C++ repo, that I don't want to waste my weekend in to understand the repo.

So I begin implementing from this awesome [cstack](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/) on building a sqlite like db from scratch , written in Zig as I wanted to learn a systems programming language.
